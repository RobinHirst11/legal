            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Health and Safety legislation aims to protect the health, safety, and welfare of people at work and those affected by work activities. In the UK, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 is the primary piece of legislation covering occupational health and safety. It places duties on employers, employees, and the self-employed to ensure the safety of all people in the workplace.
