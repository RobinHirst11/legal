            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Equality Act 2010 is a UK law that protects individuals from discrimination based on certain characteristics. It consolidates and replaces previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act, making the law easier to understand and strengthening protection in some situations. The Act covers nine protected characteristics: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.

            <h2>Key Aspects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Protected Characteristics: The Act identifies nine protected characteristics and prohibits discrimination based on these characteristics. (Source: <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/equality/equality-act-2010">The purpose of the Equality Act</a>)</li>
                <li>Direct and Indirect Discrimination: The Act distinguishes between direct discrimination (treating someone less favorably because of a protected characteristic) and indirect discrimination (applying a provision, criterion, or practice that disadvantages people with a protected characteristic).

                <li>Reasonable Adjustments: Employers and service providers must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled people are not disadvantaged. (Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/rights-disabled-person/employment">GOV.UK Rights for Disabled People</a>)</li>
